## General Info
My initial intention for this project is to replicate a simple front-end of most the popular streaming service app, Netflix, but I enjoyed working on it so I added more features. My goal for this project is to help users to find movies that they like with keywords and find movies and TV series with genres that they like. 


## Technologies Used
ReactJS 18.1.0 - a front-end Javascript library used for building user interfaces for single-page applications

Firebase 9.8.1 - a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime

Tailwind - utility-first framework to help builders implement styles quicker

TMDB api v3 - movie and TV database that lets you find all movies and TV and know more about them

## Feature
-By clicking on the movie that you like, you can watch a trailer to prepare you before you watch the actual movie
-You can also see which actors are in the movie and similar movies that matches the genre of the movie
-Home page and each genre page will show you popular, trending, upcoming movies and TV series titles
